I have updated the frontend application at `auth/frontend` to align with the new authentication flow.

Here is a summary of the changes:
- **SDK JWT Generation**: I've added a new feature to the `API Keys` page. You can now generate a short-lived SDK JWT for any of your API keys.
- **New UI Components**: A new button and dialog have been added to the `ApiKeyManager` component to handle the SDK JWT generation and display. The styling of these new components matches the existing design of the application.
- **Bug Fix**: I also fixed a minor bug related to the JWT field name in the login response type definition.

The frontend should now be fully functional with the new authentication flow. You can run the frontend development server to see the changes.

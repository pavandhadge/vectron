I have finished implementing the updated authentication setup.

Here's a summary of the changes:
- Added a new `GetAuthDetailsForSDK` RPC to the `auth` service for internal validation of SDK JWTs.
- Implemented the corresponding handler in the `auth` service.
- Updated the `apigateway` middleware to use this new RPC, fixing the authentication flow for SDKs.
- Corrected several compilation and configuration errors that were discovered during the process.
- Updated the end-to-end tests (`e2e_new_routes_test.go` and `e2e_test_helpers_test.go`) to reflect the complete and correct authentication flow.

The `TestE2E_NewRoutes` test now passes, verifying that the entire flow—from user registration and login to SDK JWT creation and its use in API calls—is working as expected.
